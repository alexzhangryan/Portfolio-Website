                    <p>I'm currently a junior at The University of Wisconsin - Madison with an expected graduation date of 2027. During my studies I've taken an interest to AI/ML and have been working on my own project such as building a neural network from scratch or working with Pytorch to create image classifiers. <br /><br />
                    Outside of class, I am a member of the UW Taekwondo club, where I was treasurer last year. During my time as treasurer I also got the opprotunity to participate in the National Collegiate Taekwondo Championship in Berkeley. I also enjoy playing games with friends, kpop, and fashion. <br /><br />
                    I'm also very interested in computer hardware and have an extensive collection of custom keyboards. From 2021-2022 I worked at Artesian Builds, a boutique PC integrator, where I was able to explore my love for computers and also build my web development skills. Around the same time I became obsessed with building my own custom keyboards where I patiently modified each individual switch to then solder them to a pcb.<br /><br />
                    I love working with large data-sets and trying to find optimal solutions to complex problems. Whether its coding or keyboards, I also love focusing on the details to make sure I have a perfect end product.
